\usage{
GenData()
}
\value{
\item{n11}{A G by Tn matrix with n11[i,j] being the count of treated subjests with an event within group i at time j. The number of strata is G=5 and the number of time intervals is Tn=20.} 
\item{n10}{A G by Tn matrix with n10[i,j] being the count of treated subjests without an event within group i at time j.}
\item{n01}{A G by Tn matrix with n01[i,j] being the count of untreated subjests with an event within group i at time j.}
\item{n00}{A G by Tn matrix with n00[i,j] being the count of untreated subjests without an event within group i at time j.}

Generate simulation data
}
\details{
Besides n11, n10, n01, n00, this function also returns some other simulation paramters, including C1, C2, C3, h2. See Ji et al. (2017) for more details.
